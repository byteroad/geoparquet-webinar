# Webinar: Navigating GeoParquet: Lessons Learned from the eMOTIONAL Cities Project

[GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/) is a cloud-native format created to address the geospatial interoperability issues between data warehouses. It is based on the widely supported columnar storage [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/), extending it to add support for geometry data types (e.g.: points, lines and polygons). Although a relatively recent format, it already has a good ecosystem of tools, and it took Standardisation very seriously by joining the path to become a full-fledged [OGC Standard](https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoparquet).

To find out more, you can attend this free webinar, to take place on [Friday, the 4th of October at 2pm UTC+1](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?day=4&month=10&year=2024&p1=224&p2=179&p3=16&p4=44&p5=240&p6=136&p7=133&iv=0). Registration is **mandatory** through [this](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrIi95ccgyuy9L6Ewskpa1qnRw6eJj-x7lb5dHhRDsnnNWsA/viewform) link. *Registered participants will receive an email with the link, shortly before the event*.

*Whatâ€™s in there for me?*

* For data users: in this webinar we will outline some benefits of using this format, for data analysis in particular, that had led us to embrace it in the [eMOTIONAL Cities project](https://emotionalcities-h2020.eu/). We will also show how you can find and access the geoParquet versions of the datasets in the eMOTIONAL Cities Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). 

* For data producers: in this webinar we will share our experience, converting and publishing the +90 datasets of the eMOTIONAL Cities Spatial Data Infrastructure SDI using a stack of FOSS/OSGeo software (GDAL, gpq, pygeoapi). We will also show you where you can find the tools we developed in the project.
